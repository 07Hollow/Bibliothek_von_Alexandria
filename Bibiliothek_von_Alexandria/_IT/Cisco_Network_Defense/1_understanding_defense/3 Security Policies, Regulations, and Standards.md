# Business Policies
Business policies are the guidelines that are developed by an organization to govern its actions. The policies define standards of correct behavior for the business and its employees. In networking, policies define the activities that are allowed on the network. This sets a baseline of acceptable use. If behavior that violates business policy is detected on the network, it is possible that a security breach has occurred.

An organization may have several guiding policies, as listed in the table.

| Policy            | Description |
| ----------------- | ----------- |
| Company policies  | - These policies establish the rules of conduct and the responsibilities of both employees and employers. <br> - Policies protect the rights of workers as well as the business interests of employers. <br> - Depending on the needs of the organization, various policies and procedures establish rules regarding employee conduct, attendance, dress code, privacy and other areas related to the terms and conditions of employment. |
| Employee policies | - These policies are created and maintained by human resources staff to identify employee salary, pay schedule, employee benefits, work schedule, vacations, and more. <br> - They are often provided to new employees to review and sign.           |
| Security policies | - These policies identify a set of security objectives for a company, define the rules of behavior for users and administrators, and specify system requirements. <br> - These objectives, rules, and requirements collectively ensure the security of a network and the computer systems in an organization. <br> - Much like a continuity plan, a security policy is a constantly evolving document based on changes in the threat landscape, vulnerabilities, and business and employee requirements. |

# Security Policy
A comprehensive security policy has benefits like:
- Demonstrates an organization's commitment to security
- Sets the rule for expected behavior
- Ensures consistency in a system operations, software and hardware acquisition and use, and maintenance.
- Defines legal consequences of violation
- Gives security staff the backing of management

Security policies are used to inform users, staff, and managers of an organizationâ€™s requirements for protecting technology and information assets. A security policy also specifies the mechanisms that are needed to meet security requirements and provides a baseline from which to acquire, configure, and audit computer systems and networks for compliance.

| **Identification and <br>authentication policy** | Specifies authorized persons that can have access to network resources and identify verification procedures                              |
| **Password policy**                               | Ensures passwords meet minimum requirements and are changed regulary                                                                     |
| **Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)**                   | Identifies network application and uses that are acceptable to the organization. It may also identify ramification if policy is violated |
| **Remote access policy**                          | Identifies how remote users can access a network and what is accessible via remote connectivity.                                         |
| **Network maintenance policy**                    | Specifies network device operating systems and end user application update procedures                                                    |
| **Incident handling procedures**                  | Describes how security incidents are handled                                                                                             | 

# BYOD (Bring your own device) Policies
Many organizations must now also support Bring Your Own Device (BYOD). This enables employees to use their own mobile devices to access company systems, software, networks, or information. BYOD provides several key benefits to enterprises, including increased productivity, reduced IT and operating costs, better mobility for employees, and greater appeal when it comes to hiring and retaining employees.

It should accomplish the following:
- Specifies the goal of the BYOD program
- Identify which employee can bring their own devices
- Identify which device will be supported
- Identify the level of access employees are granted when using personal devices
- Describe the rights to access and activities permitted to security personnel on the device
- Identify which regulations must be adhered to when using employee devices 
- Identify safeguards to put in place if a device is compromised

**BYOD best practise:**

| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Password protected access**                      | Use unique passwords for each device and account                                                                                                          |
| **Manually control <br>wireless connectivity**      | Turn of Wi-FI and Bluetooth when not in use. Connect only to trusted networks                                                                             |
| **Keep updated**                                    | Always keep the device OS and other software updated. Updated software often contains security patches to mitigate against the latest threats or exploits |
| **Back up data**                                    | Enable backup of the device in case it is stolen or lost                                                                                                  |
| **Enable "Find my device"**                         | Subscribe to a device locator service with remote wipe feature                                                                                            |
| **Provide antivirus software**                      | Provide antivirus software for approved BYOD device                                                                                                       |
| **Use mobile Device** <br>**Management (MDM) software** | MDM software enables IT teams to implement security settings and software configurations on all devices that connected to company networks                | 

# Regulatory and Standards Compliance
There are also external regulations regarding network security. Network security professionals must be familiar with the laws and codes of ethics that are binding on Information Systems Security (INFOSEC) professionals.

Many organizations are mandated to develop and implement security policies. Compliance regulations define what organizations are responsible for providing and the liability if they fail to comply. The compliance regulations that an organization is obligated to follow depend on the type of organization and the data that the organization handles.
