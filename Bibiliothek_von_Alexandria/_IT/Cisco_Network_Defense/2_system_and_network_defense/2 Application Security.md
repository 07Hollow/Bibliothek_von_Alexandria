# Security Coding Techniques
When coding applications, developers use several techniques to validate that all security requirements have been met.

**Normalization:**
Normalization is used to organize data in a database and help maintain data integrity. Normalization converts an input string to its simplest known form to ensure that all strings have unique binary representations and that any malicious input is identified.

**Stored procedure:**
A stored procedure is a group of precompiled SQL statements stored in a database that execute a task. If you use a stored procedure to accept input parameters from clients using different input data, you will reduce network traffic and get faster results.

**Obfuscation and camouflage:**
A developer can use obfuscation and camouflage to prevent software from being reverse engineered. Obfuscation hides original data with random characters or data. Camouflage replaces sensitive data with realistic fictional data.

**Code reuse:**
Code reuse means using existing software to build new software, saving time and development costs. Care must be taken, though, to avoid the introduction of vulnerabilities.

**SDKs:**
Third-party libraries and software development kits (SDKs) provide a repository of useful code to make application development faster and cheaper. The downside is that any vulnerabilities in SDKs or third-party libraries can potentially affect many applications.

# Input Validation
Controlling the data input process is key to maintaining database integrity. Many attacks run against a database and insert malformed data. Such attacks can confuse, crash or make the application divulge too much information to the attacker. Scroll down to look at an example — in this case, an automated input attack.

Customers fill out a web application form to subscribe to a newsletter. A database application automatically generates and sends email confirmations back to the customers. When customers receive the email with a URL link to confirm their subscription, attackers have modified the URL link. 

These modifications can change the username, email address or subscription status of the customers when they click to confirm their subscription. This way, when the email is returned to the host server, it receives bogus information, which it might not be aware of if it does not check each email address against subscription information.

Hackers can automate this attack to flood the web application with thousands of invalid subscribers to the newsletter database.

# Validation rule
A validation rule checks that data falls within the parameters defined by the database designer. A validation rule helps to ensure the completeness, accuracy and consistency of data. The criteria used in a validation rule include the following:

- Size – checks the number of characters in a data item
- Format – checks that the data conforms to a specified format
- Consistency – checks for the consistency of codes in related data items
- Range – checks that data lies within a minimum and maximum value
- Check digit – provides for an extra calculation to generate a check digit for error detection


# Integrity check

Compromised data can threaten the security of your devices and systems.

An integrity check can measure the consistency of data in a file, picture or record to ensure that it has not been corrupted. The integrity check performs a hash function to take a snapshot of data and then uses this snapshot to ensure data has remained unchanged. A checksum is an example of a hash function.

**How a checksum works:**
A checksum verifies the integrity of files, or strings of characters, before and after they transfer between devices across a local network or the Internet. Checksums convert each piece of information to a value and sum the total. To test the data integrity, a receiving system repeats the process. If the two sums are equal, the data is valid. If not, a change has occurred somewhere along the line.

**Hash functions:** 
Common hash functions include MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256 and SHA-512. These use complex mathematical algorithms to compare data to a hashed value. For example, after downloading a file, the user can verify the integrity of the file by comparing the hash values from the source with the ones generated by any hash calculator.

**Version control:**
Organizations use version control to prevent authorized users from making accidental changes. Version control means that two users cannot update the same object, such as a file, database record or transaction, at the exact same time. For example, the first user to open a document has the permission to change that document; the second person who tries to open it while the first user is still working on it will only be able to access a read-only version.

**Backups:**
Accurate backups help to maintain data integrity if data becomes corrupted. An organization needs to verify its backup process to ensure the integrity of the backup.

**Authorization:**
Authorization determines who has access to an organization’s resources based on a need-to-know basis. For example, file permissions and user access controls ensure that only certain users can modify data. An administrator can set permissions for a file to read-only. As a result, a user accessing that file cannot make any changes.

# Other Application Security Practices

**Code signing:**
Code signing helps prove that a piece of software is authentic.
Executables designed to install and run on a device are digitally signed to validate the author’s identity and provide assurance that the software code has not changed since it was signed.

**Secure cookies:**
Using secure cookies protects information stored in cookies from hackers.
When your client system interacts with a server, the server sends a HTTP response that instructs your browser to create at least one cookie. The cookie then stores data for future requests while you are browsing that website.
Web developers should use cookies with HTTPS, to secure cookies and prevent them from being transmitted over unencrypted HTTP.

# Managing Threats to Applications
Organizations can implement various measures to manage threats to the application domain.

**Unauthorized access to data centers, computer rooms and wiring closets:**
- Implement policies, standards and procedures for staff and visitors to ensure the facilities are secure.

**Server and system downtime:**
- Develop a business continuity plan for critical applications to maintain availability of operations.
- Develop a disaster recovery plan for critical applications and data.

**Network operating system software vulnerability:**
- Develop a policy to address application software and operating system updates.
- Install patches and updates regularly.

**Unauthorized access to systems:**
- Use multi-factor authentication.
- Monitor log files.

**Data loss:**
- Implement data classification standards.
- Implement backup procedures.

**Software development vulnerabilities:**
- Conduct software testing prior to launch.
