# Biometrics
Biometrics are the physiological or behavioral characteristics of an individual, and there are security practices based on identifying and granting access using biometrics.

Biometric authentication systems can include measurements of the face, fingerprint, hand geometry, iris, retina, signature and voice.

Biometric technologies can be the foundation of highly secure identification and personal verification solutions. The popularity and use of biometric systems have increased because of the rise in security breaches and transaction fraud.

Biometrics can ensure confidential financial transactions and personal data privacy — a well-known example being smartphones which use fingerprint readers to unlock the device and access apps, including online banking and payment systems.

When selecting biometric systems, there are several important factors to consider, including:
- Accuracy
- Speed or throughput rate
- Acceptability to users
- Uniqueness of the biometric organ and action
- Resistance to counterfeiting
- Reliability
- Data storage requirements
- Enrollment time
- Intrusiveness of the scan

The most important of these factors is accuracy, which is expressed in error types and rates.

The first error rate is Type I errors or false rejections. A Type I error rejects a person that registers and is an authorized user. In access control, where the main objective is to keep cybercriminals away, false rejection is the least important error. It means that someone who should gain access is not granted access.

However, in many biometric applications, particularly retail or banking, false rejections can have a very negative impact on business due to a transaction or sale being lost.

False acceptance is a Type II error. Type II errors allow entry to people who should not have entry, meaning a cybercriminal can potentially gain access. For this reason, Type II errors are normally considered the most important error for a biometric access control system.

The acceptance rate is also an important concept here. Stated as a percentage, it is the rate at which a system accepts unenrolled individuals or imposters as authentic users – so the rate of Type II errors per total instances of granting permission.

# Badges and Access Logs
An access badge allows an individual to gain access to an area with automated entry points.

1. An access badge is swiped
2. An access badge is swiped
3. The system sends the number to a computer
4. The system sends the number to a computer
5. The system sends the number to a computer

# Surveillance
Many physical access controls, including deterrent and detection systems, ultimately rely on people to intervene and stop the actual attack or intrusion.
